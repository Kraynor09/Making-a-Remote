Making a remote with a Ardunio 

Bellow you will find a tutorial on how to make a remote that works with any Infred device. 

What you will need: 

1. Ardunio 
2. 100ohm Resistor
3. Ir Reciver 
4. Ir Transmitter
5. BreadBoard 
5. JumpWires

Start by connecting your breadboards negtive rail to ground. Then connect the postive rail to 3.3v, the reason you are connecting the postive rail to 3.3v is beacuse to much volatge can kill the ir transmitter. Once you have your positve and negtive connected, place the 100 ohm Resistor to the negtive rail on the breadboard, then the other end to the the middle of the bread board. Next, place the ir transmitters + leg nex to the second end of the resitor, and then place the other end(-) anywhere on the board. Once you have done that, place a Jumper Wire next to the negtive pin on the Transmitter, and connect that jump Wire to pin 3 of your Ardunio.
